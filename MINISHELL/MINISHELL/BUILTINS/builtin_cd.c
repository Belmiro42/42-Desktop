DESCRIPTION: SYNOPSIS
cd [-L|-P] [directory]

NOTE: No flags operates as -L which includes step 8 and 9

DESCRIPTION: DESCRIPTION
NOTE: if ARGCOUNT > 2
NOTE: 		ERROR


1. If no directory operand is given and the HOME environment variable is empty
or undefined, the default behavior is implementation-defined and no further
steps shall be taken.

NOTE: if ARGCOUNT == 1
NOTE:		if (strchr(getenv(HOME), '/') == NULL)

2. If no directory operand is given and the HOME environment variable is set to
a non-empty value, the cd utility shall behave as if the directory named in the
HOME environment variable was specified as the directory operand.

NOTE:		else
NOTE:		{
NOTE:			export()
TODO: 	Figure out how to do this but figure out if you need to change OLDPWD to
		PWD and if you need to change the pwd variable. Check what chdir does
NOTE:			chdir(getenv(HOME))
NOTE:		}


3. If the directory operand begins with a <slash> character, set curpath to the
operand and proceed to step 7.

DESCRIPTION: OPERANDS
NOTE: If directory is an empty string, the results are unspecified.
-  When a <hyphen-minus> is used as the operand, this shall be equivalent to:
	cd "$OLDPWD" && pwd


NOTE: if arg[2][0] = '-'
NOTE:		{
NOTE:			export()
TODO: 	Figure out how to do this but figure out if you need to change OLDPWD to
		PWD and if you need to change the pwd variable. Check what chdir does
NOTE:			chdir(getenv(OLDPWD)
NOTE:		}

NOTE: if arg[2][0] = '/'
NOTE:		seven = true

4. If the first component of the directory operand is dot or dot-dot, proceed to
step 6.

NOTE: if (arg[2][0] = '.' && seven == false)
NOTE: 		six = true

5. Starting  with  the  first  pathname in the <colon>-separated pathnames of
CDPATH (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section) if the pathname is non-null, test
if the concatenation of that pathname, a <slash> character if that pathname did
not end with a <slash> character, and the directory operand names a directory.
If the pathname is null, test if the concatenation of dot, a <slash> character,
and the operand names a directory. In either case, if the resulting string names
an existing directory, set curpath to that string and proceed to step 7.
Otherwise, repeat this step with the next pathname in CDPATH until all
pathnames have been tested.

6. Set curpath to the directory operand.

????

7.If curpath does not begin with a <slash> character, set curpath to the string
formed by the concatenation of the value of PWD, a <slash> character if the
value of PWD did not end with a <slash> character, and curpath.

NOTE: 	if (curpath[0] != '\')
NOTE: 	{
NOTE: 		char *cpy = PWD;
NOTE: 		while (*cpy)
NOTE: 			cpy++;
NOTE: 		if (*(--cpy) != '/')
NOTE: 			curpath = ft_strhoin("/", curpath, KEEP, DEL)
NOTE: 		curpath = ft_strjoin(getenv("PWD"), curpath, KEEP, DEL)
NOTE: 	}

8. The curpath value shall then be converted to canonical form as follows,
considering each component from beginning to end, in sequence:

	a. Dot components and any <slash> characters that separate them from the
	next component shall be deleted.

	b. For each dot-dot component, if there is a preceding component and it is
	neither root nor dot-dot, then:

		i.  If the preceding component does not refer (in the context of		TODO: Also
		pathname resolution with symbolic links followed) to a directory, then
		the cd utility shall display an appropriate error message and  no
		further  steps shall be taken.
		
NOTE: 	char *strcpy;
NOTE: 	strcpy = malloc(sizeof(char) * ft_strlen(curpath));
NOTE: 	int iterator;
NOTE: 	iterator = 0;
NOTE: 	int iterator_copy;
NOTE: 	iterator_copy = 0;
NOTE: 	while (curpath[iterator])
NOTE: 	{
NOTE: 	if (curpath[iterator] == '/' && curpath[iterator] == '.' && curpath[iterator] == '.')
NOTE: 	{
NOTE: 		check_path_valid();								TODO: Follow Symbolic Links Aswell
NOTE: 		iterator += 3;
NOTE: 	}
NOTE: 	else if (curpath[iterator] == '/' && curpath[iterator] == '.')
NOTE: 		iterator += 2;
NOTE: 	else if (curpath[iterator] == '/' && curpath[iterator] == '/')
NOTE: 		iterator += 1;
NOTE: 	else
NOTE: 		strcpy[iterator_copy++] = curpath[iterator++];
NOTE: 	}
NOTE: 	strcpy[iterator_copy] = curpath[iterator];
NOTE: 	free(curpath);
NOTE: 	curpath = strcpy;


	c. An  implementation  may  further  simplify  curpath  by removing any			NOTE: DONE ABOVE
	trailing <slash> characters that are not also leading <slash> characters,
	replacing multiple non-leading consecutive <slash> characters with a single
	<slash>, and replacing three or more leading <slash> characters with a
	single <slash>.  If, as a result of this canonicalization, the curpath
	variable is null, no further steps shall be taken.


9. If curpath is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the terminating null) 			TODO: ?? IS NECESSSARY?
and the directory operand was not longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the			?? I reckon dont do this as we need to save value in pwd
terminating null), then curpath shall be converted from an  absolute
pathname  to  an  equivalent relative pathname if possible.

NOTE: 	chdir(curpath)
NOTE: 	export() //OLDPWD to be PWD
NOTE: 	export() //PWD to be curpath

10. The cd utility shall then perform actions equivalent to the chdir() function		chdir(curpath)
called with curpath as the path argument. If these actions fail for any reason,			export() //OLDPWD to be PWD
the cd utility shall display an appropriate error message and the remainder of			export() //PWD to be curpath
this step shall not be executed. If the -P option is not in effect, the PWD
environment variable shall be set to the value that curpath had on entry to step
9 (i.e., before conversion to a relative  pathname). If  the  -P option is in
effect, the PWD environment variable shall be set to the string that would be
output by pwd -P.  If there is insufficient permission on the new directory, or
 on any parent of that directory, to determine the current working directory,
 the value of the PWD environment variable is unspecified.

If, during the execution of the above steps, the PWD environment variable is
set, the OLDPWD environment variable shall also be set to the value of the old
working directory (that is the current working  directory  immediately prior to
the call to cd).
